    "# The added value of modelling premise plumbing systems\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a premise plumbing system?\n",
    "\n",
    "Premise plumbing systems is a reference to the “last mile” of water delivery and is an integral part of buildings (residential or commercial). This system comprises of pipes, fixtures, fittings, and other appurtenances used for indoor water supply, heating, and sanitation. This plumbing system is connected to the outdoor drinking water distribution network via a service line. Typically, the owner of the premise is also responsible for the plumbing system within. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The challenges in understanding premise plumbing systems\n",
    "\n",
    "The plumbing system offers challenges in various ways:\n",
    "- There is a diversity in households and thus, also, diversity in the composition of plumbing systems (driven by choices during construction and historical choices of premise owners).\n",
    "- There is seldom availability of documentation for existing plumbing systems. Unlike the distribution network with a centralized owner (drinking water utility), the plumbing system is the domain of individual property owners. \n",
    "- Plumbing systems are hidden behind walls which makes it difficult to extract useful information. For example, which materials are present in the system.\n",
    "- The flow within a plumbing system is intimately linked to the water demand at the premise level. Water consumption is stochastic in nature (water demand is not predictable at every instant, but its statistics can be estimated). This means that water usage/flow is intermittent with multiple periods of standstill.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The role of modelling in understanding premise plumbing systems better\n",
    "\n",
    "The ultimate goal of a water distribution system is to ensure that potable and safe drinking water is delivered without any additional risks to consumer health. The quality of drinking water at the tap is decide by the complex interplay between the characteristics of the plumbing and the flow in the system determined by water consumption. The deterioration of water quality can occur either in a microbiological or chemical sense. \n",
    "\n",
    "Doing tests in real households is challenging because of the various unknowns surrounding the plumbing system. A proxy for real plumbing systems are testbeds or experimental facilities at the laboratory scale. A few such testbeds to study phenomena in plumbing systems under controlled conditions already exist. Examples include the Home Plumbing Simulator in the USA and the HomeWaterLab in the Netherlands. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another avenue for researching phenomena in premise plumbing systems is through modelling. A __[recent book](https://doi.org/10.1061/9780784485101)__ summarizes modelling efforts and applications. Modelling offers a bottom-up approach to studying the phenomena taking place in premise plumbing. This is facilitated through the underlying equations that drive the model mechanics. A shortcoming of modelling, however, is that not all phenomena in real systems can be included with the equations, i.e. the modelling will be restricted by the choice of assumptions and simplifications."

    "# **LEadGO** - Mechanistic model for dissolution and propagation of substances through a premise plumbing system\n",
    "A mechanistic model has been developed to study the dissolution and propagation of substances through a premise plumbing systems. The backbones of this model are EPANET/WNTR and (py)SIMDEUM. \n",
    "- __[EPANET](https://www.epa.gov/water-research/epanet)__ is a modelling software that is capable of simulating the hydraulic and water quality behavior in pressurized pipe networks. Examples of hydraulic parameters include flow rate and pressures. Examples of water quality parameters include the age of water or the concentration of a chemical. EPANET is a freely available software with a graphical user interface. __[WNTR](https://usepa.github.io/WNTR/)__ is a freely available python package that also possesses the major functionalities and capabilities of EPANET. Note that EPANET files can also be accessed with text editors such as __[Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)__.\n",
    "- In a plumbing system, the hydraulics are determined by the demand induced by the residents/users/apparatus at the premise level. Water demand is stochastic in nature and its statistics can be captured. The program __[SIMDEUM](https://www.kwrwater.nl/en/tools-producten/simdeum/)__ uses these statistics to create water demand patterns. SIMDEUM is a Matlab program and recently, a python version of SIMDEUM has been introduced – __[pySIMDEUM](https://github.com/kwr-water/pysimdeum)__.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following ingredients are needed to set up the model (as illustrated in the figure below):\n",
    "- Premise plumbing system geometry: The plumbing system is a physical system and can be defined by means of it dimensions (lengths and diameters of pipes). The plumbing system is branched and the branch ends at a consumption point (a point where water is consumed or used). The layout of the geometry is determined by the relative placement of the demand points and the pipe characteristics. The geometry is made on EPANET.  \n",
    "- Water demand: The flow in the plumbing system is driven by the demand generated at the consumption points, which in turn is driven by aspects such as the number of end users and their attitude towards water usage (for example, conscious about water saving). The demand patterns (water demand as function of time) are generated for each consumption point. The demands are generated using SIMDEUM.\n",
    "- Substance dissolution: Substance releasing locations need to be assigned to certain pipes. Substance dissolution in water can be characterized by two parameters – an equilibrium concentration and a dissolution timescale. The equilibrium concentration is the maximum concentration of the substance that can dissolve in the water whereas the dissolution timescale represents how quickly the equilibrium concentration can be achieved. These values can be added to EPANET.\n",

    "<b>LEadGO - What's in a a name?: </b> We refer to the abovementioned mechanistic model as LEadGO. Even though the model is applicable for several substances, it was originally developed and used for lead in drinking water. This modelling framework uses building blocks to arrive at the end result, similar to LEGO. In this model lead \"goes\" from the walls (leaching) and \"goes\" towards the demand points (propagation). Eventually, the outputs of this model can be used to determine where lead \"goes\" within the human body. Moreover, the model can be extended to test sampling protocols to detect and localize lead-releasing components, as we eventually want them to \"go\" away.\n",

It means that the generation of input files (geometry of plumbing system and integration of water demand patterns) is a pre-processing step to be taken by the user.

The recommended naming of the input files is “ABCxx.inp”. “ABC” can be a name of the users choice, for example “Apartment” or “PlumbingInput”. This prefix is followed by “xx” which refers to a two digit number.

    "    - Number of files: This defines the number of input files that will simulated and is related to the suffix for the input files.  \n",
    "- **consumption_properties**: This variable has multiple fields that are related to the generated consumption patterns.\n",
    "    - Consumption Points: This is the list of all nodes (or junctions) that where water is demanded. An EPANET input file has multiple nodes – nodes that are a demand point and nodes that are simply present to connect pipes. Open the EPANET input file and view the list of junctions. Junction names attributed to the demand points are added to this variable with the function `extract_demand_nodes`.\n",
    "    - Pattern Duration [s]: This is the total duration for which water demand patterns have been created. This is a value to be expressed in seconds. \n",
    "    - Pattern Timestep [s]: This refers to the granularity of the water demand patterns, i.e. what is the resolution at which water demand can change. This is a value to be expressed in seconds.\n",

    "- **time_properties**: This variable has multiple fields that are related to the desired timesteps for the simulations. \n",
    "    - Hydraulic Timestep [s]: This timestep determines how often a hydraulic simulation is performed. Ideally, this should be equal to the timestep used for generating water demand patterns. Hydraulic simulations at a certain timestep are not dependent on the previous timestep. Therefore, the choice here will not affect hydraulic parameters (flow and pressure) but can affect water quality parameters (substance concentration). If this value is greater than either the pattern or report timestep, the hydraulic timestep will be automatically reduced.\n",
    "    - Quality Timestep [s]: This timestep determines the fineness with which water quality simulations are performed. In contrast to hydraulic simulations, water quality simulations at a certain timestep are dependent on the outcomes of the previous step. It is recommended to keep this value lower than the hydraulic timestep (at least with a factor ten). Timesteps have integer values and the lowest possible value is unity. \n",
    "    - Duration [s]: This refers to the total duration of the simulations. It is recommended to choose a value twice the total duration for which water demand patterns are generated. \n",
    "    - Report Timestep [s]: This refers to how often the calculated values are logged.  \n",

    "- **quality_properties**: This variable has multiple fields regarding the parameters surrounding water quality simulations.\n",
    "    - Parameter: Determines the kind of water quality analysis that is to be performed. The default value for the current script is ‘CHEMICAL’ to simulate substance dissolution and propagation.\n",
    "    - Units: Determines the units for which the chemical concentrations are computed. Acceptable values are ‘mg/L’ and ‘ug/L’.\n",
    "    - Tolerance: Determines the accuracy with which the water quality simulations are performed. If two water parcels have a chemical concentration lower than this value, they are then considered to be equal. The default value is 0.01 (with corresponding units). Lowering this value will lead to increased computational time.\n",

    "    - Locations: This is an array of all pipes (or links) where the substance can leach into water.\n",
    "- **factor**: This is a numerical value with which the time and demand properties of simulations are altered. All water demands are reduced by the factor while all timesteps are increased with the same factor. This is necessary to combat the high displacement of water in short pipes (caused by high velocities) which can lead to inaccuracies in water quality computations. Therefore, the timestep for water quality calculations is not adjusted to allow for a greater separation between hydraulic and water quality timescales. The higher the factor, the longer the computational times. Details regarding this are explained in __[this paper](https://doi.org/10.4995/WDSA-CCWI2022.2022.14741)__. \n",
